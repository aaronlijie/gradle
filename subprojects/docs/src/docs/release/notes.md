The Gradle team is pleased to announce Gradle 4.0.

We are excited to share _5_ noteworthy improvements with you:

It gives us great joy to announce that the [Build Cache](https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-gradle-build-cache) is now fully
production-ready with [several improvements](#build-cache-improvements)! 

Now on to user experience. We've made a number of display enhancements for builds using a terminal. For logging, we have made logs more
actionable by **grouping output by project and task** and reducing unnecessary noise.

[TODO image]

Note that logging behaves the same as 3.x in non-interactive environments to allow automated tools like CI to parse the logs they expect.

Additionally, the console now shows more detail about what exactly is in progress, and parallel work-in-progress is now displayed by default.

[TODO GIF]

And on the topic of parallel work-in-progress, this release includes APIs that allow plugins to schedule **parallel work by default**.
The Gradle Android Plugin is already using these APIs in their preview builds to improve speed of Android builds. Dependencies are
also now **downloaded in parallel** as well!

[Gradle Script Kotlin v0.9.0](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin/releases/tag/v0.9.0) brings us one last step closer to v1.0, with
auto-detection of Kotlin build scripts, improved samples and docs with an [API reference](https://gradle.github.io/gradle-script-kotlin-docs/api/),
and source code navigation!

[TODO nother gif]

Finally, one of the most-requested features by plugin authors is addressed in Gradle 4.0. We introduced a public type for
representing an officially-supported way to represent lazily-evaluated properties (aka ConventionMapping). Read more [below](TODO).

## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Public type for representing lazily evaluated properties

Because Gradle's build lifecycle clearly distinguishes between configuration phase and execution phase the evaluation of property
 values has to be deferred under certain conditions to properly capture end user input. A typical use case is the mapping of
 extension properties to custom task properties as part of a plugin implementation. In the past, many plugin developers were forced to solve evaluation order problems by using the concept of convention mapping, an internal API in Gradle subject to change.

This release of Gradle introduces a mutable type to the public API representing a property with state. The relevant interface is called [`PropertyState`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/PropertyState.html). An instance of this type can be created through the method [`Project.property(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#property-java.lang.Class-).

The following example demonstrates how to use the property state API to map an extension property to a custom task property without
running into evaluation ordering issues:

    apply plugin: GreetingPlugin

    greeting {
        message = 'Hi from Gradle'
        outputFiles = files('a.txt', 'b.txt')
    }

    class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {
        void apply(Project project) {
            // Add the 'greeting' extension object
            def extension = project.extensions.create('greeting', GreetingPluginExtension, project)
            // Add a task that uses the configuration
            project.tasks.create('hello', Greeting) {
                message = extension.messageProvider
                outputFiles = extension.outputFiles
            }
        }
    }

    class GreetingPluginExtension {
        final PropertyState<String> message
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles

        GreetingPluginExtension(Project project) {
            message = project.property(String)
            setMessage('Hello from GreetingPlugin')
            outputFiles = project.files()
        }

        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }

        Provider<String> getMessageProvider() {
            message
        }

        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }

        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }
    }

    class Greeting extends DefaultTask {
        final PropertyState<String> message = project.property(String)
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles = project.files()

        @Input
        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }

        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        void setMessage(Provider<String> message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }

        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }

        @TaskAction
        void printMessage() {
            getOutputFiles().each {
                it.text = getMessage()
            }
        }
    }

### Build Cache Improvements

#### Remote build cache honors `--offline` 

When running with `--offline`, Gradle will disable the remote build cache.

#### Detecting overlapping task outputs

When two tasks write into the same directory, Gradle will now disable task output caching for the second task to execute. This prevents issues where task outputs for a different task are captured for the wrong build cache key. On subsequent builds, if overlapping outputs are detected, Gradle will also prevent you from loading task outputs from the cache if it would remove existing outputs from another task.

You can diagnose overlapping task output issues by running Gradle at the `--info` log level. If you are using [Gradle Build Scans](https://gradle.com/scans/get-started), the same detailed reason for disabling task output caching will be included in the build timeline. 

#### Stricter validation of task properties

When a plugin is built with the [Java Gradle Plugin Development Plugin](userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html), custom task types declared in the plugin will go through validation. In Gradle 4.0, additional problems are now detected. 

A warning is shown when:

- a task has a property without an input or output annotation (this might indicate a forgotten input or output),
- a task has `@Input` on a `File` property (instead of using `@InputFile` of `@InputDirectory`),
- a task declares conflicting types for a property (say, both `@InputFile` and `@InputDirectory`),
- a cacheable task declares a property without specifying `@PathSensitive`. In such a case, we default to `ABSOLUTE` path sensitivity, which will prevent the task's outputs from being shared across different users via a shared cache.

For more info on using task property annotations, see the [user guide chapter](userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:task_input_output_annotations).

#### Cache-safe mixed JVM language compilation

In Gradle 3.5, projects that used both Java and another JVM language (like Groovy or Scala) would encounter problems when using the build cache. The class files created by multiple compilation tasks were all placed into the same output directory, which made determining the set of outputs to cache for each task difficult and would cause Gradle to cache the wrong outputs for each compilation task.

Gradle now uses separate output directories for each JVM language. 

#### Automatic clean-up of local build cache

By default, Gradle limits the size of the local build cache to 5GB. In Gradle 3.5, the local build cache was allowed to grow indefinitely.

You can increase or decrease the size of the local build cache by configuring your local cache:

    buildCache {
        local {
            // Set target size to 10GB
            targetSizeInMB = 10240
        }
    }

This is a _target_ size for the build cache. Gradle will periodically check if the local build cache has grown too large and trim it to below the target size. The least recently used build cache entries will be deleted first.

### Checkstyle configuration directory conventions

If you use additional configuration files with [Checkstyle](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html), like `suppressions.xml`, these files need to be specified with an absolute path. Most projects use a variable like `config_loc` to build the path to these configuration files.
 
Gradle now defines a `config_loc` property that can be used in your `checkstyle.xml`.  See the [user guide](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html#sec:checkstyle_built_in_variables) for more information.

This change makes Checkstyle build cache friendly, so that your build does not need to depend on machine-specific paths and is more likely to keep track of all inputs to the `Checkstyle` task. 
 
### Parallel download of dependencies

Gradle will now download dependencies from remote repositories in parallel (both metadata and artifacts). It will also make sure that if you build multiple projects in parallel (with `--parallel`) and that 2 projects try to download the same dependency at the same time, that dependency wouldn't be downloaded twice.

### Default Zinc compiler upgraded from 0.3.7 to 0.3.13

This will take advantage of performance optimizations in the latest [Zinc](https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc) releases.

### Ivy plugin repositories support patterns and layouts

Ivy plugin repositories now support the same API for patterns and layouts that Ivy artifact repositories support.

### Ignore classpath resources for up-to-date checks and the build cache

It is now possible to ignore resources on the classpath for up-to-date checks and the build cache.
Often a project has a file containing volatile data (like some ID to identify the CI job that published the artifact or a timestamp) which should be packaged into the jar for auditing reasons.
As soon as such a file is present, the `test` task will never be up-to-date or from the build cache since on every Gradle invocation the contents of this file - and by this this the inputs to the task - would change.
It is now possible to tell Gradle about these files by configuring [resource normalization](userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:custom_resource_normalization):

    normalization {
        runtimeClasspath {
            ignore 'build-info.properties'
        }
    }

The effect of this configuration would be that changes to build-info.properties would be ignored for up-to-date checks and build cache key calculations.
Note that this will not change the runtime behavior of the Test task - i.e. any test is still able to load build-info.properties and the classpath is still the same as before.

For more information on this feature see the corresponding section in the [userguide](userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:custom_resource_normalization).

## Track Groovy Compiler JVM Java version

The Java version of the JVM the Groovy compiler runs on influences the compiler output.
Gradle now track this Java version and the Groovy compilation tasks will re-run when this version changes.
Currently, the version of this JVM is always the same as the version of the Gradle JVM.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

<!--
### Example promoted
-->

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation
-->

### Setting the compiler executable is no longer deprecated

In Gradle 3.5 `ForkOptions.executable` has been deprecated. In Gradle 4.0 it is not deprecated anymore, but using it to fork a compiler will disable task output caching for the compile task.

## Potential breaking changes

### Build Scan 1.7.1 or newer is required when used with Gradle 4.0

To support additional features, you must use [Build Scan 1.7.1](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.build-scan) or newer with Gradle 4.0.

### Multiple class directories for a single source set

In projects that use multiple JVM languages (Java and Scala, Groovy and other languages) in separate source directories (e.g., `src/main/groovy` and `src/main/java`), Gradle now uses separate output directories for each language. 

To return to the old behavior, explicitly set the classes directory:

    // Change the output directory for the main source set back to the old path
    sourceSets.main.output.classesDir = new File(buildDir, "classes/main")

Please be aware that this will interfere with the effectiveness of the build cache when using multiple JVM languages in the same source set. Gradle will disable caching for tasks when it detects that multiple tasks create outputs in the same location.

### Location of classes in the build directory

The default location of classes when using the `java`, `groovy` or `scala` plugin has changed from:

    Java: build/classes/main
    Groovy: build/classes/main
    Scala: build/classes/main
    Generically: build/classes/${sourceSet.name}

to

    Java: build/classes/java/main
    Groovy: build/classes/groovy/main
    Scala: build/classes/scala/main
    Generically: build/classes/${sourceDirectorySet.name}/${sourceSet.name}

Plugins, tasks or builds that used hardcoded paths may fail. You can access the specific output directory for a particular language via [`SourceDirectorySet#outputDir`](dsl/org.gradle.api.file.SourceDirectorySet.html#org.gradle.api.file.SourceDirectorySet:outputDir) or the collection of all of the output directories with [`SourceSetOutput#getClassesDirs()`](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceSetOutput.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceSetOutput:classesDirs).

### maven-publish and ivy-publish mirror multi-project behavior

When using the `java` plugin, all `compile` and `runtime` dependencies will now be mapped to the `compile` scope, i.e. "leaked" into the consumer's compile classpath. This is in line with how
 these legacy configurations work in multi-project builds. We strongly encourage you to use the `api`(java-library plugin only), `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` configurations instead. These
 are mapped as expected, with `api` being exposed to the consumer's compile classpath and `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` only available on the consumer's runtime classpath.

### Memory settings not tracked as inputs for JVM compilation

Previously Gradle would treat JVM compilation tasks as out-of-date whenever their memory settings changed compared to the previous execution. Since Gradle 4.0, these parameters are not treated as inputs anymore, and thus the compilation tasks will stay up-to-date when they are changed.

### Groovy upgraded to 2.4.11

The version of Groovy bundled with Gradle was changed from Groovy 2.4.10 to [Groovy 2.4.11](http://www.groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.11.html).

This release fixes several issues where Groovy compilation could produce different (but functionally equivalent) bytecode given the same source files due to nondeterministic ordering in the compiler. These problems could cause build cache misses in Gradle 3.5 when compiling Groovy and Gradle script sources.

### Version of PMD has been upgraded

By default, Gradle now uses [PMD 5.6.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd/5.6.1/). Previously, Gradle used PMD 5.5.1. 

Newer versions of PMD usually bring new rules, better inspections and bug fixes. Your build may fail due to these changes.

You can upgrade or downgrade the version of PMD with:

    pmd {
        toolVersion = '5.5.1'
    }

### Changes to previously deprecated APIs

- The `JacocoPluginExtension` methods `getLogger()`, `setLogger(Logger)` are removed.
- The `JacocoTaskExtension` methods `getClassDumpFile()`, `setClassDumpFile(File)`, `getAgent()` and `setAgent(JacocoAgentJar)` are removed.
- Removed constructor `AccessRule(Object, Object)`.
- Removed constructor `ProjectDependency(String, String)` and the methods `getGradlePath()`, `setGradlePath(String)`.
- Removed constructor `WbDependentModule(Object)`.
- Removed constructor `WbProperty(Object)`.
- Removed constructor `WbResource(Object)`.
- Removed constructor `JarDirectory(Object, Object)`.
- Removed constructor `Jdk(Object, Object, Object, Object)`.
- Removed constructor `ModuleDependency(Object, Object)`.
- Moved classes `RhinoWorkerHandleFactory` and `RhinoWorkerUtils` into internal package.
- Removed `RhinoWorker`.
- Removed constructor `EarPluginConvention(Instantiator)`.
- Removed the method `registerWatchPoints(FileSystemSubset.Builder)` from `FileCollectionDependency`.
- Removed the method `getConfiguration()` from `ModuleDependency`.
- Removed the method `getProjectConfiguration()` from `ProjectDependency`.
- Removed class `org.gradle.caching.BuildCache`.
- Removed class `org.gradle.caching.MapBasedBuildCache`.
- Removed the [Gradle GUI](https://docs.gradle.org/3.5/userguide/tutorial_gradle_gui.html). All classes for this feature have been removed as well as all leftovers supporting class from the Open API partly removed due to deprecation in Gradle 2.0.
- Removed the annotation `@OrderSensitive` and the method `TaskInputFilePropertyBuilder.orderSensitive`.
- Removed `dependencyCacheDir` getter and setters in java plugin and `CompileOptions`
- Removed Ant <depend> related classes `AntDepend`, `AntDependsStaleClassCleaner`, and `DependOptions`
- Removed `Javadoc#setOptions`
- Removed `Manifest.writeTo(Writer)`. Please use `Manifest.writeTo(Object)`
- Removed `TaskInputs.source()` and `sourceDir()`. Please use `TaskInputs.file().skipWhenEmpty()`, `files().skipWhenEmpty()` and `dir().skipWhenEmpty()`.
- Chaining calls to `TaskInputs.file()`, `files()`, `dir()` and `TaskOutputs.file()`, `files()` and `dir()` are not supported anymore.
- Removed `TaskOutputs.doNotCacheIf(Spec)`, use `doNotCacheIf(String, Spec)` instead.

The deprecated `jetty` plugin has been removed. We recommend using the [Gretty plugin](https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty) for developing Java web applications.
The deprecated `pluginRepositories` block for declaring custom plugin repositories has been removed in favor of `pluginManagement.repositories`.

### Adding copy specs is not allowed during task execution of a `AbstractCopyTask` task

You can no longer add copy specs to a copy (like `Copy` and `Sync`) or archive task (like `Zip` and `Tar`) when the task is executing. Tasks that used this behavior could produce incorrect results and not honor task dependencies. 

Starting with Gradle 4.0, builds that rely on this behavior will fail.  Previously, Gradle only failed if the task was cacheable and emitted a warning otherwise. 

```groovy
// This task adds a copy spec during the execution phase.
task copy(type: Copy) {
    from ("some-dir")
    into ("build/output")

    doFirst {
        // Adding copy specs during runtime is not allowed anymore
        // The build will fail with 4.0
        from ("some-other-dir") {
            exclude "non-existent-file"
        }
    }
}
```

### Changes to how build cache configurations are described

The (incubating) [`BuildCacheServiceFactory`](javadoc/org/gradle/caching/BuildCacheServiceFactory.html) and
 [`BuildCacheService`](javadoc/org/gradle/caching/BuildCacheService.html) interfaces have changed in this release.
This only affects custom build cache connector implementations.
It does not affect usage of the build cache connectors that ship with Gradle.

Previously, the `BuildCacheService` was responsible for providing a `getDescription()` method that returned a human friendly description of the cache.
This responsibility has been moved to the associated `BuildCacheServiceFactory` implementation, that now receives a `Describer` parameter. 
The custom service factory can use this to declare the type of the service and configuration parameters that are relevant to the build cache connector being created. 
`getDescription()` has been removed.

An example of the factory method used to create a custom build cache connector with a `BuildCacheServiceFactory`: 

```java
public class InMemoryBuildCacheServiceFactory implements BuildCacheServiceFactory<InMemoryBuildCache> {
    @Override
    public BuildCacheService createBuildCacheService(InMemoryBuildCache config, Describer describer) {
        int maxSize = config.getMaxSize();
        describer.type("in-memory").config("size", String.valueOf(maxSize));
        return new InMemoryBuildCacheService(maxSize);
    }
}
```
